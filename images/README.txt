smlogo1.xcf is a GIMP file used to create the ic_wm_shuttle.png files
located in ../RPIMobile/res/drawable-xxxxx.

If a better "Shuttles" icon is desired, edit as you please and then:

1) Export the project in GIMP as the highest quality PNG possible.

2) Then use Android Asset Studio:
     http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/icons-actionbar.html
       to create the ActionBar icons.
